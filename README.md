The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in India was very high in the year 1990 with 556 
women dying during childbirth per hundred thousand live births as 
compared to the global MMR of 385/lakh live births.
As per the sample registration system (SRS) report by Registrar General of 
India for the last 3 years, the MMR of India has reduced from 130/lakh live 
births in SRS (2014-2016) to 122 in SRS (2015-2017) and 113/lakh live births 
in SRS (2016-2018). India has registered an overall decline in 
MMR of 70% between 1990 and 2015 in comparison to a global decline of 44%. Although 
India has made considerable progress in the reduction of maternal and infant mortality, 
every year approximately 44,000 women still die due to pregnancy-related causes and 
approximately 6.6 lakh infants die within the first 28 days of life. Many of these 
deaths are preventable and many lives can be saved if quality care is provided to pregnant 
women during their antenatal period and high-risk factors such as severe anemia, 
pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) etc., 
are detected on time and managed well.
