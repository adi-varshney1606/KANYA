            <p> Smoking while pregnant puts both you and your unborn baby at risk. 
              Babies born to women who smoke during pregnancy are more likely to
              have a lower birth weight and are at a greater risk for learning
              disabilities than children born to nonsmoking mothers.

            <p>
